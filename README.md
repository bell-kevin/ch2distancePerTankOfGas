# ch2distancePerTankOfGas
A car with a 20 gallon gas tank averages 23.5 miles per gallon when driven in town and 28.9 miles per gallon when driven on the highway. Write a program that calculates and displays the distance the car can travel on one tank of gas when driven in town and the distance it can travel on one tank of gas when driven on the highway. Take a screenshot of the running program displaying the results.  Here is an example using different values. The tank holds 10 gallons, town driving averages 30.5 miles per gallon, highway driving averages 50.5 miles per gallon.  Ch 2 Distance  Take a screenshot of the result when using the numbers specified above (20 gallon gas tank, 23.5 MPG in town, 28.9 MPG on the highway). Run the project again with different numbers (which cannot be the numbers in the example above), and take a screenshot.     NOTE: Remember the requirements for a header and a pause at the end of the program, discussed in the reading "Console Applications". These are required in every console application project.  Submission: Submit a single zipped folder containing all of the specified screenshots AND the root folder for the project.
