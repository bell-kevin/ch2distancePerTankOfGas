# ch2distancePerTankOfGas
A car with a 20 gallon gas tank averages 23.5 miles per gallon when driven in town and 28.9 miles per gallon when driven on the highway. Write a program that calculates and displays the distance the car can travel on one tank of gas when driven in town and the distance it can travel on one tank of gas when driven on the highway. Take a screenshot of the running program displaying the results.  Here is an example using different values. The tank holds 10 gallons, town driving averages 30.5 miles per gallon, highway driving averages 50.5 miles per gallon.  Ch 2 Distance  Take a screenshot of the result when using the numbers specified above (20 gallon gas tank, 23.5 MPG in town, 28.9 MPG on the highway). Run the project again with different numbers (which cannot be the numbers in the example above), and take a screenshot.     NOTE: Remember the requirements for a header and a pause at the end of the program, discussed in the reading "Console Applications". These are required in every console application project.  Submission: Submit a single zipped folder containing all of the specified screenshots AND the root folder for the project.


== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project. I have a [website](https://bellKevin.me) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign 
from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not 
a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
email me at **bellKevin@pm.me** for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
